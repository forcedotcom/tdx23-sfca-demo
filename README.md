# Code Analyzer Demo

This repo is a demo to show how workflows can be created to utilize code-analyzer-action GitHub Action plugin.

When this project is linked to a DevOps Center setup and connected to scratch orgs, it can automatically invoke Salesforce Code Analyzer when a work item is moved to Ready for Review.

Have a look at `.github/workflows/sfca.yml`.

TODO: More workflow examples and references.
